# Default Meteor Boilerplate

After running `meteor create [projectName]` you have only three files
	• project-name.js
	• project-name.html
	• project-name.css

This repository has exactly same code, but in better structure.

	/client/
		application/
		helpers/
		includes/
		stylesheets/
			style.css
		views/
			hello/
				hello.html
				hello.js
	/collections/
	/lib/
	/public/
	/server/
		startup.js
	/main.html

Have a happy meteoring! :)

## NOTE!
Believe me, only thing changed there is structure, so remember to remove autopublish and insecure packages by yourself.
